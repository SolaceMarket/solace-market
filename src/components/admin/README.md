/**
 * Admin Trading Feature - Testing Guide
 * 
 * This file documents how to test the admin trading functionality
 * that has been implemented on asset pages.
 * 
 * Features Implemented:
 * 1. User selection component for choosing which user to trade for
 * 2. Trading form component with full order type support
 * 3. API endpoint for executing trades on behalf of users
 * 4. Asset page integration with admin-only visibility
 * 5. Comprehensive admin middleware protection
 * 
 * Admin Protection Layers:
 * - Client-side: useAdminCheck hook verifies admin status before showing UI
 * - Server-side: verifyAdminAccess middleware protects API endpoints
 * - Database: Admin emails are stored in ADMIN_EMAILS array in adminAuth.ts
 * 
 * To Test:
 * 
 * 1. As Admin User:
 *    - Log in with an email listed in ADMIN_EMAILS
 *    - Navigate to any asset page (e.g., /assets/AAPL)
 *    - You should see the "Admin Trading Panel" section
 *    - Select a user from the dropdown (only users with active broker accounts)
 *    - Fill out the trading form and submit
 *    - Check that the order is placed successfully
 * 
 * 2. As Regular User:
 *    - Log in with a non-admin email
 *    - Navigate to any asset page
 *    - The admin trading panel should NOT be visible
 *    - API endpoints should return 403 Forbidden if accessed directly
 * 
 * 3. As Unauthenticated User:
 *    - Visit asset pages without logging in
 *    - Admin trading panel should NOT be visible
 *    - API endpoints should return 401 Unauthorized
 * 
 * API Endpoints:
 * - GET /api/admin/users - List users with broker accounts
 * - POST /api/admin/trade - Execute trades on behalf of users
 * 
 * Components:
 * - UserSelector: Dropdown to select users
 * - TradingForm: Form for entering trade details
 * - AdminTradingSection: Combined UI component
 * - AssetPageAdminSection: Client-side wrapper with admin check
 * 
 * Security Features:
 * - All admin API calls require valid Firebase auth token
 * - Server-side validation of admin status using database or Firebase
 * - Client-side admin check prevents UI from showing to non-admins
 * - Trade logging for audit purposes
 * - Input validation and error handling
 * - User broker account status verification
 * 
 * Order Types Supported:
 * - Market orders

 * - Buy/Sell sides
 * - Time in force options (Day, GTC, IOC, FOK)
 * - Extended hours trading
 * - Fractional shares (if asset supports it)
