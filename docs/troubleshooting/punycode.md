(node:47633) [DEP0040] DeprecationWarning: The `punycode` module is deprecated. Please use a userland alternative instead.
(Use `node --trace-deprecation ...` to show where the warning was created)

Solution found at [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/77737680):

```
$nvm install --lts
$nvm use --lts
```

The LTS version was then stored in the [.nvmrc](/.nvmrc) file.
